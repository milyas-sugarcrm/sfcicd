    <textOnly>Hello Phunions,

It&apos;s been 12 hours since the mockup for Invoice {!Order.Invoice_Number__c} was sent to the customer and we haven&apos;t received approval. Please follow up with {!Order.WOAccountLink__c} to avoid delays.

URGENT: This Invoice is marked as Critical. Delays in mockup approval will delay the order.

{!Order.WONameLink__c}

Thanks,

Ralph the Rooster</textOnly>
