    <textOnly>Hello Operations Team:

This is a friendly reminder that itâ€™s been 24 hours since {!PurchaseOrder_LineItem__c.Name} moved into a Ready for Pickup Status. Please ensure a delivery is scheduled, and notify {!PurchaseOrder_LineItem__c.OwnerFullName} if there are any delays resulting from delivery interruptions.

If {!PurchaseOrder_LineItem__c.Name} has been received at QC, please update the PO Status to Received at QC.

Thanks a bunch,
