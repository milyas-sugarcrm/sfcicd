    <textOnly>Hello Phunions,

THIS WORK ORDER IS MARKED AS CRITICAL.

It&apos;s been 12 hours since Invoice {!Order.Invoice_Number__c} was sent to the customer and we haven&apos;t received payment. Please follow up with {!Order.WOAccountLink__c} immediately. Delays in payment will delay the order and may cause the due date to not be met.

{!Order.WONameLink__c}

Thanks,

Ralph the Rooster</textOnly>
